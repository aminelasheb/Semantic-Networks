# Semantic-Networks
In this Jupyter Notebook, I applied the concepts of Semantic Networks using Python &amp; NetworkX to implement an example of the Titi bird from the course. I enjoyed the experience &amp; believe the example showcases my understanding of the concepts. I gained hands-on experience &amp; feel grateful for the opportunity to apply my knowledge.
